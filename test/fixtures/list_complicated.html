It&#39;s best to indent the paragraphs four spaces
You can get away with three, but it can get

Stick to four.</p>

it with these paragraphs. In real use, we might do
that to the entire list so that all items line up.</p>

<p>This paragraph is still part of the list item, but it looks messy to humans. So it&#39;s a good idea to wrap your nested paragraphs manually, as we did with the first two.</p></li>
